database.py — Student BizDir
Backend Lead (Member 2) owns this file.

This file is the BRIDGE between Flask (app.py) and the SQLite database.
Every database operation in the entire project flows through functions here.

HOW SQLITE WORKS (quick mental model):
  - SQLite is a database stored as a single file: bizdir.db
  - You open a "connection" to talk to it
  - You run SQL commands (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT) through that connection
  - You close the connection when done
  - Python's built-in sqlite3 module handles all of this — no install needed!
"""

import sqlite3  # Built into Python — no pip install needed
import os       # For building file paths


# CONFIGURATION


# This is the path to our database file.
# It will be created automatically when init_db() runs for the first time.
DATABASE_PATH = "bizdir.db"


# DATABASE SCHEMA


# This is the SQL that creates the businesses table.
# Think of a table like a spreadsheet — each field is a column.
# This runs once when the app starts (see init_db below).

# FIELD EXPLANATIONS:
#   id              — Auto-generated unique number for each business (1, 2, 3...)
#   business_name   — e.g. "Amara's Braids"
#   owner_name      — e.g. "Amara Johnson"
#   category        — e.g. "Food", "Fashion", "Tech"
#   description     — At least 20 chars (enforced in app.py validation)
#   whatsapp        — Optional contact number
#   phone           — Optional phone number
#   location        — Optional e.g. "Block C, Room 12"
#   delivers        — 0 = No, 1 = Yes (stored as integer, not true/false)
#   photo_filename  — Just the filename e.g. "photo_abc123.jpg" (NOT full path)
#   date_added      — Auto-set to current time when row is inserted
#   is_verified     — 0 = pending review, 1 = approved and visible
#                     THIS IS YOUR SECURITY FEATURE — show judges this!


# FUNCTION 1: get_connection()


def get_connection():

    Opens and returns a connection to the SQLite database.

    WHY row_factory?
      By default, sqlite3 returns rows as plain tuples like (1, "Amara's Braids", ...)
      With Row factory, you can access columns BY NAME like: row["business_name"]
      This makes the rest of the code much easier to read and write.
