app.py — Student BizDir
Backend Lead (Member 2) owns this file.

This is the ENTRY POINT of the entire web application.
When a user visits a URL, Flask looks here for a matching route and runs that function.

HOW FLASK WORKS (quick mental model):
  1. User types http://localhost:5000/ in their browser
  2. Flask sees the URL "/" and finds the matching @app.route("/")
  3. Flask runs that Python function
  4. The function returns HTML (via render_template) or a redirect
  5. Flask sends that HTML back to the browser

JINJA2 TEMPLATES:
  render_template("index.html", businesses=businesses)
  This sends the businesses list to the HTML file.
  In the HTML, Member 1 can then use: {% for b in businesses %}
